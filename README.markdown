##JavaScript last.fm API Readme

###Overview

The JavaScript last.fm API allows you to call last.fm API methods and get the
corresponding JSON responses. Basically it just acts as a wrapper that gives
easy access to API methods. Responses can be cached using the localStorage API.


###Encoding

You don't need to worry about encoding when calling API methods. Everything
should automatically be UTF-8 encoded and decoded by your browser if you set
the Content-Type for your document to UTF-8:

    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8" />


###Authentication

It's easy to fetch a session for a user account. This allows you to perform
actions on that account in a manner that is secure for last.fm users. All
write services require authentication.


###Write methods

Due to technical restrictions it's not possible to get a response when calling
write methods. Reading responses is only possible using HTTP Access-Control,
which is currently not supported by the last.fm API.


###Submissions

Scrobbling is not yet supported.


###Usage

You need to add the following scripts to your code in order to work with the
JavaScript last.fm API:

  <script type="text/javascript" src="lastfm.api.md5.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="lastfm.api.js"></script>

If you want to use caching, you need to add another script:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="lastfm.api.cache.js"></script>

Built in JSON support should be available in modern browsers, if you want to
be sure it's supported, include the following:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="json2.js"></script>

You can get that file at http://www.json.org/json2.js , and make sure you've
removed the first line before using it.

Now you can use the JavaScript last.fm API like this:

    /* Create a cache object */
    var cache = new LastFMCache();

    /* Create a LastFM object */
    var lastfm = new LastFM({
      apiKey    : 'f21088bf9097b49ad4e7f487abab981e',
      apiSecret : '7ccaec2093e33cded282ec7bc81c6fca',
      cache     : cache
    });

    /* Load some artist info. */
    lastfm.artist.getInfo({artist: 'The xx'}, {success: function(data){
      /* Use data. */
    }, error: function(code, message){
      /* Show error message. */
    }});
